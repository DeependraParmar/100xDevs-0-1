// Que 01. Why we need languages?
// Languages are basically the way for us to get the work done from the computers and machines. From the top, languages like C++,Java, JavaScript are high level languages which got the compiler to convert the code into machine level code. Then there are low level languages like Assembly language which are directly converted into machine level code. Then there are machine level languages which are directly understood by the machine. After you double click on the application present in your system, the compiler basically compiler the whole set of the files and the package and bring it to the RAM.

// Que. 02 What is a compiler? 
// Compiler convert high level developer-friendly code into machine level code. It is a program which is used to convert the code into machine level code or 0's and 1's. Compiler of C++ is g++ and for Java is javac.


// Que 03: Compiled vs Interpreted Code
// Compiled languages are the languages which uses the compiler, converting the file into binary and then runnning the binary while the interpreted laguages provides line by line execution.
// CL dont compile if there is an error in the code while IL will give error on the number of line it is and does the partial execution.


// Que.04 JS >>> other languages
// Browsers understand JS and 

// Que.05 Strictly typed and dynamically typed
// Doesn't allows change the type of the data stored in the variable. In loosely/dynamically typed, you can change the type of the data that is stored in variables.


// Que.06 Single thread nature of JS
// JS execution is limited to a single core and is single threaded in nature that's why its a bad language for scalable systems.
